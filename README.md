This is a React Native Project to create a Dashboard for Sandbox. 

To start this project run yarn install then run yarn ios to run in an iOS simulator.

To start, you will be asked to create a profile. Please add your first and last name. Then add a description about yourself. Next you can add profile picture from the web. This profile picture will need to be a url of the photo. For the seed data I copied the Image Address. 

After doing this, you can submit and create the account. It will automatically take you to your profile page. You can click the back arrow in the top left to go back to the dashboard. In the dashboard there is a header with your profile initials with more navigation options. You can select edit profile to make changes. All profiles will show the profiles already added to the server. My profile will take you back to your profile page.

This was a fun project where I learned a lot about React Native in regards to navigation as well as submitting forms.
